# unit-4-game
A Simple Math Game

The user is shown a randomized number, which is the number to hit. She is also shown four crystals with hidden numerical values. The user clicks on the crystals to tally her total. The user wins if her counter is equal to the number to hit. She loses if her counter is greater than the number to hit. The game resets itself. 

To make this game, JavaScript (specifically jQuery) was used. JQuery was used to form counters, a reset function, and randomized numbers.
